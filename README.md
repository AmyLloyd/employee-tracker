# employee-tracker

## Description
The inspiration for building this app was to explore how the relationships between different roles and people in a company can be organised, recorded and accessed. Mapping a tree-like structure with branches into each department and levels of responsibility in very important in large companies. 

This app solves the problem of tracking a large workforce at a company. With many departments and many employees, companies need to know who is on their staff, how much they are being paid and what their roles are at a click of a button. 

I have learnt how to use MySQL statements including inner joins. It has also been helpful to learn about promises when using inquirer.
